// edit-request PRs, direct edit) moved to kungal in the "编辑面归 kungal" wave,
// and the taxonomy STAFF console plus the UI-less links/aliases relation writes
// were retired in wave 159 (N4) — the catalog owns the vocabulary now and
// kungal hosts the one staff surface. Nothing here edits anything any more, so
// the old name only misdirected whoever came looking for the edit face.

// Both calls go through OUR backend proxy (/api/v1/...), which composes the
// page from the catalog and relays {code,message,data} (see
// internal/patch/handler/galgame_edit.go).

// BrowseTag / BrowseOfficial are the PUBLIC taxonomy pages' entities. Their ids
// are CATALOG ids since wave A2-2 (P2 / R1).
